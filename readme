My code isnt complete yet however this is what I have so far, in this project if the goal was to gauge an understanding of how I code and possibly show off some of my skills.
in this project I have used react and created some hooks to some components
also I worked on doing a very secure login and sign up system with help of firebase 
in adition to that for the calander i used syncfusion already built in component
I added 0 styling to this, just very basic bootstrap within this usually i would do some css styling but with tailwinds
